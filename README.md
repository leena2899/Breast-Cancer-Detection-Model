# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model
I have created this project to detect cancer on basis of patients data, as we know in this world no one is perfect so we can't expect from machines to be perfect we can only increase their accuracy rate. In this project I used three machine learning models. The prediction has been done by using best fit accuracy model.
